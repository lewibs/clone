# dev notes
In progress of setting up attack link... but the website generation is working.
ngrok is sadly not a good option

all html pages should have meta at the bottom of the head tag:
```html
<meta type='falseEnd'>
```

all html pages should have script at the bottom of the html:
```html
<script type='attackLogic'></script>
```

all html pages should have 3 ids:
```js
id="login"
id="username"
id="password"
```
